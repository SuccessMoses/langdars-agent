## Dynamic Action Resampling (DARS) Coding Agent with LangGraph

This project implements an autonomous coding agent utilizing the **Dynamic Action Resampling (DARS)** algorithm for robust problem-solving in software repositories. The agent's workflow and state management are orchestrated using the **LangGraph** framework.

Inspired by the original DARS-Agent [2], this implementation bypasses the need for Docker by leveraging LangGraph's capabilities for building stateful, graph-based agents.

LangGraph enhances customization and enables advanced features like RAG and persistent state, making the agent more powerful.

The goal is to create a terminal-based AI pair programmer, similar to Aider [1], but powered by the DARS algorithm for improved decision-making and performance on coding tasks.
